## 🚧 Active Blockers & Risk Management

### 🔴 **Critical Blockers (2)**

#### Blocker #1: Facebook Developer Account Approval
- **Impact**: Backend webhook development delayed
- **Owner**: Frank (Backend Dev)
- **Blocker Duration**: 2 days
- **Mitigation**: 
  - PM escalating via Facebook partner team (Diana's contact)
  - Continue development with mock data
  - Parallel path: Setup development webhook endpoints
- **Target Resolution**: October 18, 2025
- **Risk Level**: Medium (alternative paths available)

#### Blocker #2: Cloud Infrastructure Budget Approval  
- **Impact**: Staging environment setup delayed
- **Owner**: Charlie (MIS)
- **Blocker Duration**: 1 day
- **Mitigation**: 
  - PM meeting with Finance today (3:00 PM)
  - Use local development environment as backup
  - Pre-approve smaller budget for immediate needs
- **Target Resolution**: October 17, 2025 (Today)
- **Risk Level**: Low (internal process, expected approval)

### 🟡 **Minor Risks (3)**

1. **Framework Decision Delay** (Eve - Frontend)
   - Impact: Frontend development start delayed by 1 day
   - Mitigation: Technical review scheduled today 3:30 PM

2. **RLHF Documentation Gap** (Iris - QA, Diana - UX/UI)
   - Impact: Test planning and UX design incomplete
   - Mitigation: Technical review includes RLHF walkthrough

3. **Training Data Format Alignment** (Bob - SE, Henry - Live Ops)
   - Impact: ML model development delay potential
   - Mitigation: Sync meeting scheduled post-standup
